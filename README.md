# RuralHack

A place to store all the code and information for the RuralHack experimentations held during several workshops held **since summer 2016 in Italy and Mediterranean Areas** by the then-called Officine Arduino (now [Officine Innesto](http://officine.cc/)) and then called  [Ruralhub](https://www.facebook.com/RuralHub), now migrated itself in [Ruralhack](http://www.ruralhack.org/).

Ruralhack is now purchasable for Italian Public Administration through [MEPA](https://www.acquistinretepa.it/)

# Structure of the Repository

You can see two main folders.
In the **[/exercises](https://github.com/OfficineArduinoTorino/RuralHack/tree/master/exercises)** you can find basic examples of use of several sensors used in the workshop, while in the **[/libraries](https://github.com/OfficineArduinoTorino/RuralHack/tree/master/libraries)** folder some of the main libraries used are hosted. Unfortunately some of them have a intense development so we strongly advice you to download them - where possible - from the **Arduino Library Manager** if using **Arduino Java IDE**.

# The Kit

The list of components used in the workshop is a kit on sale on the [Arduino Store](https://store.arduino.cc/rural-hack-kit).

The Kit (designed to be used with a [Arduino MKR board](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-genuino/arduino-genuino-mkr-family)), while most of the code you'll find here is tested on [Arduino MKR 1000](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkr1000-with-headers-mounted) and [Arduino MKR 1010](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkr-wifi-1010) features:

- Humidity Sensor (DHT22)
- Log-scale Analog Light Sensor ([Ga1a12s202 in its Adafruit's Flavour](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1384))
- [Soil Moisture Sensor](https://www.tindie.com/products/miceuz/i2c-soil-moisture-sensor) (aka the slim chirp) from [Miceuz](https://www.tindie.com/stores/miceuz/)
- [Grove Relay Module](http://seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Relay-p-769.html) from Seeed
- Resistors / pushbuttons / connectors

# The workshop

We've done this workshop several times in the last two years.

The main aim of a this workshop is giving people access to new technologies. We have released all the teaching material for you to toy around the kit *indipendently*.

Most codes are not by us, in some cases adaptations of somebodyelse's code and projects, we tried to create diagrams of some specific setups using [Fritzing](fritzing.org/). Most of the Workshop notes are in the /presentation-materials folder

The basic idea behind the workshop was create some sort of automatization inside of a rural scenario, with wifi connectivity and not a large area to look after. We started little to grow big.
